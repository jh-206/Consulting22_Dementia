abstract: Stream temperature is an important environmental indicator as ecological
  problems arise when streams get too warm. Wildfires can impact stream temperatures
  in several ways, such as directly heating waters or destroying vegetation that provides
  cooling shade. Climate change is projected to cause increased wildfire activity,
  and it is important to understand how this will affect water quality. Using streamflow
  data from USGS, wildfire data from the National Interagency Fire Center, and climate
  data from PRISM, we develop a regression model for seasonal stream temperature for
  several locations in Colorado. We examine the relationship between wildfire activity
  and stream temperature in Colorado.

# Introduction

Aquatic ecosystems are adapted to specific temperature ranges, and many ecological problems arise when waters get too warm or too cold.^[USGS, "Temperature and Water". https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/temperature-and-water?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects] In the freshwater streams of Colorado, aquatic species such as plankton, insects, and fish depend on very cool waters. The Greenback Cutthroat Trout, the state fish of Colorado and a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, depends on waters as cold as 45 â€“ 55 $^\circ$C when spawning.^[NRCS, "Coldwater Fish Stream Habitat", page 5. https://efotg.sc.egov.usda.gov/references/public/CO/coldwaterfish.pdf] There are many environmental conditions that influence stream temperature.

Wildfires can affect stream temperature in several ways. Fires can directly heat waters, but they can also destroy bands of lush vegetation that tend to line rivers and streams which provide cooling shade. These bands of vegetation are called riparian zones.^[USFS, "Fire and Riparian Areas". https://www.fs.fed.us/psw/topics/fire_science/ecosystems/riparian.shtml] With climate change projected to cause increased wildfire activity, it is important to understand how this will affect water quality. 
The goal of this analysis is to build an accurate regression model of seasonal stream temperature, and investigate what effect wildfire activity has on stream temperature.


# Data Acquisition

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) operates water quality monitoring sites across the nation which collect data on numerous environmental variables. ^[USGS, "Water-Quality Data for the Nation". https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/qw] USGS developed the R package *dataRetrieval* to allow researchers to easily access water quality data.^[USGS, "Introduction to the dataRetrieval package". https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataRetrieval/vignettes/dataRetrieval.html] Using this package, we collected data from the time period of 2000-2018 on the variables listed in Table 1. River discharge, or flow rate, measures the total volume of water moving through the stream per second. All things equal, a larger mass of water takes more energy to heat up. Basin drainage area is a measure of the land area that feeds a stream water through precipitation drainage.^[USGS, "Temperature and Water".] Spatial data on major river basin boundaries, geographic areas that have connected streamflow and groundwater patterns, come from the Colorado Department of Natural Resources.^[Colorado DNR, "GIS Data By Category". https://cdss.colorado.gov/gis-data/gis-data-by-category] Table 2 below lists the number of unique USGS sites per major river basin. In total, data was collected from 34 sites in 6 different river basins.^[There were no sites that met the filtering criteria from the Rio Grande River Basin, the only major basin in Colorado not included.] The observations were then averaged over the season of the observation date. A map of the USGS sites with major river basin boundaries can be seen in Figure 1.

  caption = "USGS Site Locations by River Basin"
)
```

Climate data from the PRISM Climate Group was collected using the R package climateR.^[ https://prism.oregonstate.edu/],^[The climateR package was developed by Mike Johnson of NOAA.] The daily maximum air temperature and precipitation in millimeters was extracted at the locations of the USGS sites over the relevant time period. The climate data was combined with the water quality data by location and time. Air temperature strongly influences water temperature, and rainfall can have a warming affect on streams.^[Benyahya et. al., "A Review of Statistical Water Temperature Models". *Canadian Water Resources Journal* September 2007: page 181.]

The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) provides spatial data for the locations, dates, and sizes of wildfires in America from 2000-2018.^[NIFC, "Historic Perimeters Combined 2000-2018". https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/historic-perimeters-combined-2000-2018?geometry=47.717%2C-9.831%2C68.108%2C74.202] Colorado had 953 recorded wildfires over this time period. The total number of fires and total acres burned in a season was calculated for each major river basin. We combined this data with the water quality data, using year, season, and basin to combine the data.


# Data Exploration

In this section, we explore several relationships between the variables. All variables observed over time have been combined by year and season (and by basin for wildfire data). The response variable for modeling will be water temperature. The distribution for water temperature can be seen in Figure 2. The range of temperatures is wide because the observations include cold mountain streams in the winter and warm waters in the summers.

*Insert Figure 2*

Water temperature has a strong relationship with air temperature and season, as seen in Figure 3. Clearly, both water and air temperatures are coolest in the winter and warmest in the summer. The relationship is largely linear, but the relationship flattens out for lower water temperatures. This dynamic is complicated, but it is in part due to how very cold water resists freezing solid when it is flowing through a channel.^[Benyahya, 2007.]

*Insert Figure 3*

Stream discharge is strongly related to season, as seen in Figure 4. Flow rates are highest in the summer and lowest in the winter. The relationship between discharge and water temperature is much less clear. In the first plot, discharge can be seen to span several orders of magnitude, and the relationship with water temperature is not readily apparent. This suggests a log transformation might be worth investigating. In the second plot, the relationship between log discharge and water temperature is complex, partly due to repeated observations from the same USGS sites having related discharges. There is a slight positive relationship between log discharge and water temperature.

*Insert Figure 4*

Altitude has a strong negative relationship with water temperature which is largely linear, as can be seen in the left plot of Figure 5. Unsurprisingly, streams at higher altitudes have cooler water. In Colorado, altitude is strongly related to longitude due to the relative north-to-south orientation of the Rocky Mountains in the middle of the state. In the plot on the right of Figure 5, the altitude increases to a peak and then decreases as you move east-to-west. Each point in these plots represents the overall average temperature for a single stream monitoring site, as for the stream altitude is treated as constant through time.

*Insert Figure 5*

In the left plot of Figure 6, drainage area has a positive but nonlinear relationship with water temperature. Additionally, drainage area spans over several orders of magnitude. These relationships suggest a log transformation might be needed. On the right of Figure 6, the log transformation of drainage area has a much more linear relationship with water temperature. In these plots, each point represents the overall average temperature for a USGS site, as drainage area is treated as constant through time.

*Insert Figure 6*

For the predictors related to wildfires, the number of wildfires in a season is obviously related to the total number of acres burned in a season. To avoid using both correlated predictors, the total number of acres burned will be considered for modeling. Conceptually, the total number of acres burned mostly captures the information found in the total number of wildfires. The effect on the environment of two small fires would seem to be similar to effect of one wildfire that was the size of the two smaller ones put together. The relationship between total acres burned in a river basin and water temperature is depicted in Figure 7. The acres burned in a basin is strongly related to season: there is the most wildfire activity in the summer and the least in the winter. A log transformation might be considered for modeling because the acres burned by wildfire spans several orders of magnitude and the relationship with water temperature appears nonlinear.^[To account for seasons with zero acres burned by wildfire, the log transformation needs to be shifted by adding one.] It is difficult to discern, but there is a slight positive relationship between acres burned by wildfire and water temperature.

*Insert Figure 7*

Although the data contains repeated measurements at the various USGS sites, that is ignored in this analysis. Modeling the repeated measures is outside the scope of this project.

# Variable Selection and Collinearity Checks

To arrive at a set of regressors to model stream temperature, we first examine the collinearity for the full set of predictors. The predictors under consideration include: year, season, discharge, precipitation, air temperature, altitude, drainage acreage, basin indicator, and acres burned in the basin. The variance inflation factors (VIFs) are presented below in Table 3.

```{r full}
full_spec <-  Wtemp ~ yr + season + flow + prcp + tmax + alt + drain + Basin + acres_basin
mod1 <- lm(full_spec, data = waterData)

vifs <- round(car::vif(mod1)[,1], 2)
names(vifs) <- c("Year", "Season", "Discharge", "Precipitation", "Max Air Temp", "Altitude", "Drainage", "Basin", "Acres Burned")
vifs <- data.frame("Regressor" = names(vifs), "VIF Value" = vifs)
rownames(vifs) <- NULL

# Check VIF
pander::pander(
  vifs,
  caption = "Full Model VIF"
  )
```

The VIF for the season predictor is roughly 14.9. As could be seen in the exploratory plots from the previous section, many of the predictors are related to season. Discharge, precipitation, air temperature, and wildfire activity are all at their highest levels in the summer, and at their lowest levels in the winter. In order to make more valid inference on the regression parameters, the factor variable for season is amputated from the model. The VIF values for the reduced model are presented below in Table 4.

```{r mod2}
spec3 <-  Wtemp ~ yr + flow + prcp + tmax + alt + drain + Basin + acres_basin
mod3 <- lm(spec3, data = waterData)
  
vifs <- round(car::vif(mod3)[,1], 2)
names(vifs) <- c("Year", "Discharge", "Precipitation", "Max Air Temp", "Altitude", "Drainage", "Basin", "Acres Burned")
vifs <- data.frame("Regressor" = names(vifs), "VIF Value" = vifs)
rownames(vifs) <- NULL

# Check VIF
pander::pander(
  vifs,
  caption = "Reduced Model VIF"
  )
```

After removing season from the model specification, there are no remaining regressors with VIF values over 5, which is a common heuristic threshold for identifying correlated regressors. With collinearity addressed, variable selection can be undertaken without large concern for unstable parameter estimates. Using an exhaustive model search procedure, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is compared for the best models of various sizes. The basin factor variable is omitted from this step, and it will be considered for inclusion later.^[The R function *regsubsets* does not behave well with factors. Additionally, the BIC values calculated in that function differ from manually computed BIC values by a constant amount.]

*Insert Figure 8*

The minimum BIC value is for the model with 6 predictors.^[The intercept brings it to 7 total regression parameters.] The one predictor omitted from the best model by this criterion was acres burned by wildfire, which is the variable of primary research interest. Since the BIC was quite similar for the model with 7 predictors (including acres burned), the estimated out-of-sample prediction error is presented for those two models using 10-fold cross validation in Table 5.

```{r cv}
## 10-Fold Cross Validation for models with 6 and 7 predictors
cv_10fold <- caret::trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)

spec6 <- Wtemp ~ yr + flow + prcp + tmax + alt + drain
spec7 <- Wtemp ~ yr + flow + prcp + tmax + alt + drain + acres_basin
  
set.seed(5387) # set seed for reproducibility, arbitrarily use class number
mod6 <- train(spec6, data = waterData, trControl = cv_10fold, 
                 method = "lm")
mod7 <- train(spec7, data = waterData, trControl = cv_10fold, 
                 method = "lm")
  
err6 <- as.numeric(round(mod6$results[c("RMSE", "MAE")], 3))
err7 <- as.numeric(round(mod7$results[c("RMSE", "MAE")], 3))

# Compare Root mean squared error and mean absolute errors
pander::pander(
  data.frame(
  "Model Predictors" = c(6, 7),
  "Includes Acres Burned" = c("No", "Yes"),
  "RMSE" = c(err6[1], err7[1]),
  "MAE" = c(err6[2], err7[2]), check.names = F
    ),
  caption = "10-Fold Cross Validation - Acres Burned Included"
)


```

The root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are both slightly lower for the model including acres burned. Since the BIC and cross-validated values are so similar for the two models, the larger model with the variable of primary research interest will be used. Finally, the basin factor variable is added manually, and the 10-fold cross validation metrics are computed for that model. 

```{r basin}
  
# Compare adding Basin
specB <- Wtemp ~ yr + flow + prcp + tmax + alt + acres_basin + drain + Basin
modB <- train(specB, data = waterData, trControl = cv_10fold, 
                method = "lm")

errB <- as.numeric(round(modB$results[c("RMSE", "MAE")], 3))

pander::pander(
  data.frame(
  "Model Predictors" = c(7, 8),
  "Includes Basin" = c("No", "Yes"),
  "RMSE" = c(err7[1], errB[1]),
  "MAE" = c(err7[2], errB[2]), check.names = F
    ),
  caption = "10-Fold Cross Validation - Basin Included"
)
```

The RMSE and MAE are again slightly lower for the model that includes basin, so that factor variable will be included in the model. The final model is represented mathematically below. This model will be fit and checked for structural issues and violations of regression assumptions. The parameter values are represented as $\beta$'s, with $\beta_0$ corresponding to the intercept. The errors assumed to be normally distributed with mean zero and constant variance, or $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$. 

$$Water\,Temp. = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Year + \beta_2  Discharge + \beta_3  Precip. +$$
$$+ \beta_4 AirTemp + \beta_5 Altitude + \beta_6  DrainageArea + \beta_7 AcresBurned + \beta_8 Basin + \epsilon$$

# Model Structure and Assumptions

First, we examine the model with the original, non-transformed predictors. In Figure 9, there are clear nonlinear relationships for several predictors. An iterative procedure was used to compare log transformations for one variable at a time, the full details of which are omitted here. We arrived on log transformations for discharge (flow) and precipitation.^[For precipitation, the same shift discussed earlier is applied, where 1.0 is added before the log transformation is applied to account for observations with zero precipitation.]

*Insert Figure 9*

The log transformations discussed previously accounted for many of the nonlinear relationships, as can be seen in Figure 10. Although visual inspection of the relationship between acres burned and water temperature was suggestive of a log transformation, the model had a lower BIC value *without* this transformation. There is still a nonlinear pattern for air temperature ("tmax") and the Pearson residuals versus fitted values.

*Insert Figure 10*

We fit a quadratic trend for air temperature, where the square of air temperature is added to the model. In Figure 11, there is now a linear relationship with air temperature. Furthermore, the residuals versus fitted values in the bottom right plot now have a more linear relationship.

*Insert Figure 11*

The model diagnostics discussed previously in this section together give evidence that there are no major structural issues with the mean portion of the model. Next, we examine the model for influential observations and outliers. Observations 11 and 1,229 are identified as leverage points by the influence index plot seen in Figure 12. However, an outlier test with Bonferroni correction does not identify either observation as an outlier. Observation 232 is the only observation identified as an outlier.^[Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 0.01] Finally, the influence plot seen in Figure 13 show that observations 11 and 1229 have very small residuals, and the outlier at observation 232 has relatively low influence. For these reasons, combined with the lack of obvious structural issues in the residual plots, no observations will be removed from the model. 

*Insert Figures 12 & 13*

In the plot of fitted values versus residuals in Figure 14, the residuals exhibit a slight "fan" shape, where they are smaller in absolute terms for lower fitted values and then increase. Also, at lower fitted values, the residuals do not appear to be centered at zero. So the assumptions of constant error variance and mean zero errors may be violated. The plot of fitted values versus observed values is quite linear, although the trend flattens out slightly for lower fitted values. There are a number of ways this model could be extended, as will be mentioned in the discussion section. For this analysis, we will make no further structural changes.

*Insert Figure 14*


# Results

The model fit the data closely, with an adjusted $R^2$ value of roughly 0.95. For ease of interpretation, we shifted three predictors by a constant amount: acres burned by wildfire now has units of 1,000 acres, altitude now represents hundreds of feet, and drainage area represents hundreds of acres. The direction and relative magnitude of the effects is displayed in Table X, along with the relative statistical significance level.^[Three stars represents s p-value of less than $1\times 10^{-6}$]

```{r}
df_temp <- data.frame(
  Regressor = c("Year", "Log Discharge", "Log Precipitation", "Max Air Temperature - Quadratic", "Altitude", "Acres Burned", "Drainage Area", "Basin"),
  `Effect Direction` = c("Slightly Negative", "Negative", "Strongly Positive", "Strongly Positive", "Slightly Negative", "Slightly Positive", "Slightly Positive", "Mixed"),
  `Statistical Significance` = c("not significant", "***", "***", "***", "***", "not significant", "***", "Mixed"),
  check.names = F
)
pander::pander(
  df_temp,
  caption = "Variable Effects Table"
)
```

Discharge is negatively associated with water temperature, likely because a larger mass of water takes longer for the air to warm up, as mentioned previously. Precipitation was positively associated with water temperature, and the quadratic trend for air temperature was positively associated with water temperature. Altitude was negatively associated with water temperature, and basin drainage area was had a positive association. Over the 18 year period of observations, there was on average a slight downward trend in temperature, but the evidence was consistent with there being no year-to-year trend. There were observations from six river basins, and the effects plot for that predictor can be seen in Figure 15. The Arkansas River basin had on average the warmest water temperatures. Using this basin as the baseline for comparison, there were statistically significant differences between the Colorado and San Juan River basins,^[P-values of less than $1\times 10^{-6}$. In the Colorado DNR data, the San Juan River basin is grouped in with the Dolores river basin.] the latter of which had the coldest water temperatures on average. 

*Insert Figure 15*

The main research interest was for the relationship between wildfire activity and water temperature, and for this analysis the data was consistent with there being no relationship. The effects plot for acres burned can be seen in Figure 16.^[As mentioned before, the units now represent thousands of acres.] The relationship is slightly positive, but there is substantial variation. On the low end of the confidence interval, there would be a slight negative relationship between acres burned in a river basin and water temperature. This is unlikely to be the case based off of theoretical considerations, but wildfires can cause many physical and chemical changes in water systems, and there could be circumstances where there is a net cooling effect. 

*Insert Figure 16*

# Discussion

On the high end of the confidence interval, the effect size was comparable in magnitude to the mean effect sizes for altitude and drainage area.^[The 97.5 percentile coefficient for effect size was roughly $0.01$, compared to point estimates of $-0.03$ and $0.01$ for altitude and drainage area, respectively. Both altitude and drainage area were arithmetic in scale.] So while the data does not tell a clear picture, the results combined with theoretical considerations of the effects of wildfires tells us that further research is merited on the topic.

There are many ways this analysis could be extended. First, repeated observations at individual USGS monitoring sites was ignored, and this could be incorporated into a mixed effects model or some other statistical tool. Next, finer spatial and temporal resolution is needed to fully investigate the relationship between wildfires and water temperature. Finally, there are more advanced spatial methods that might be applied to the wildfire data. The analysis in this report could serve as a valuable first step in that research.

It is notable that the model provided a high degree of fit to the data, with an adjusted $R^2$ of roughly 0.95. Researchers have developed very accurate climate forecasting models, so stream temperature models such as the one in this analysis could be projected forward to study how climate change might effect aquatic ecosystems in Colorado.
